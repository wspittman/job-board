      <summary>Do we really need another job board?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          We think so! Traditional job boards prioritize employers' needs over a
          seamless experience for job seekers. This is why so many of them end
          up with cluttered interfaces and generic search functions. Better Job
          Board is different: we put the job seeker front and center. This focus
          leads to a streamlined, user-first experience with powerful, intuitive
          search and filtering tools. We're here to make finding the right job
          faster, simpler, and a whole lot better.

    <h3 class="section-header">How To Use</h3>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>I found a great job! How do I apply?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Click the "Apply" button when you find a job you're interested in, and
          we'll direct you to the employer's official application page. We never
          stand between you and the employer – you'll always apply directly
          through their preferred channel.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>How do I save my search and come back later?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Save a bookmark to the page. Every time you change your search
          criteria, the URL in your browser's address bar automatically updates,
          allowing the bookmark to save the search. Using the bookmark will
          restore your search criteria and re-run the search.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>How do I share a job with a friend?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          Click the clipboard button next to the Apply button. This will copy a
          sharable URL to your clipboard. Anyone using the URL will be brought
          back to that specific job for as long as it is available.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <h3 class="section-header">About the Jobs</h3>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>Where do you find all these jobs?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          We pull job posts directly from known employers, accessing their
          applicant tracking systems (ATS) through official APIs. This way, we
          ensure high-quality, up-to-date posts while our smart search surfaces
          the most relevant opportunities for you.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>How fresh are these jobs?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          We refresh our job posts daily to ensure you're seeing the latest
          opportunities. With that level of freshness, you can apply while
          they're still hot!
        </p>
        <p class="faq-note"></p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>How do I know these jobs are still up for grabs?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          We update our job posts every day and remove any that are no longer
          accepting applications. If you see it here, it was verified as active
          within the last 24 hours! If you do find a job that has been taken
          down since our last update, the apply link won't work.

      <summary>What data do you collect about me?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>We're committed to a privacy-first job search.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We don't require an account.</li>
          <li>
            We avoid standard analytics packages (eg. Google Analytics,
            Mixpanel, etc) and collect the minimum data needed to understand
            aggregate usage and keep the site reliable.
          </li>
          <li>
            All non-aggregate data is deleted automatically after 90 days.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Specifically, here's what we collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We store two random ids, one in your browser (localStorage) and one
            in your current tab (sessionStorage). These IDs aren't tied to
            personal identities, and they don't follow you across devices or
            browsers.
          </li>
          <li>
            When your browser makes requests to our servers (eg. by loading the
            site or making a search), it also sends these two IDs along.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We use this data to understand how people use the site, diagnose
          issues, and improve the experience.
        </p>

    </details>

    <details class="faq-item card">
      <summary>I'm hiring! Can I post my job here?</summary>
      <div class="faq-content">
        <p>
          We don't accept direct job submissions, but we regularly index job
          posts from employers who use supported applicant tracking systems
          ([Greenhouse, Lever]). If your company uses one of these ATS
          platforms, but we don't index your company's jobs, send us an email at
          contact@betterjobboard.net. Include your ATS and company ID and we'll
          look into adding your jobs.
