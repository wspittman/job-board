# Frontend 2

This package contains the second iteration of the Job Board frontend. It is a Vite-powered React application intended as a near-future replacement for the existing frontend experience.

## Getting started

From the repository root install dependencies if you have not already:

```bash
npm install
```

Then change into this workspace and run one of the available scripts.

```bash
cd packages/frontend2
```

### Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – Starts the Vite development server on `http://localhost:5173` with hot module reloading.
- `npm run build` – Type-checks the project and builds an optimized production bundle in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` – Serves the previously built bundle locally for verification.
- `npm run start` – Launches the minimal Express server (`server.js`) used to host the built assets.

```

## Environment variables

The development server relies on the backend proxy defined in `vite.config.ts`. For production, `server.js` reads these variables:

| Variable  | Description                                                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`    | Port used by the Express static file server (defaults to `8080`).                                         |
| `API_URL` | Base URL for proxied API requests, including the `/api` prefix (defaults to `http://localhost:3000/api`). |

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the backend service is running (or `API_URL` points to a deployed instance) so proxied API calls succeed during development and production.
