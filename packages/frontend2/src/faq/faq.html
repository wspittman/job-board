          <summary>Do we really need another job board?</summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              We think so! Traditional job boards prioritize employers' needs
              over a seamless experience for job seekers. This is why so many of
              them end up with cluttered interfaces and generic search
              functions. Better Job Board is different: we put the job seeker
              front and center. This focus leads to a streamlined, user-first
              experience with powerful, intuitive search and filtering tools.
              We're here to make finding the right job faster, simpler, and a
              whole lot better.

          <summary>Where do you find all these jobs?</summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              We pull job posts directly from known employers, accessing their
              applicant tracking systems (ATS) through official APIs. This way,
              we ensure high-quality, up-to-date posts while our smart search
              surfaces the most relevant opportunities for you.

          <summary>How fresh are these job posts?</summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              We refresh our job posts daily to ensure you're seeing the latest
              opportunities. With that level of freshness, you can apply while
              they're still hot!

          <summary>I found a great job! How do I apply?</summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              When you find a job you're interested in, just click "Apply" and
              we'll direct you to the employer's official application page. We
              never stand between you and the employer – you'll always apply
              directly through their preferred channel.

          <summary>Can I save jobs for later?</summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              To save a job for later, click "Apply" to open the employer's
              official application page, then bookmark it in your browser.

          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              When you update your search criteria, the URL in your browser's
              address bar will update automatically. You can bookmark this URL
              to save your search and return to it later. Using the bookmark
              will restore your search criteria and re-run the search.

          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              We update our job posts every day and remove any that are no
              longer accepting applications. If you see it here, it was verified
              as active within the last 24 hours! If you do find a job that has
              been taken down since our last update, the apply link won't work.

              We're committed to privacy-first job search. We don't require an
              account and don't track individual users. We do log IP addresses
              and general search patterns to improve our site and prevent
              misuse, but this data isn't linked to personal identities.

          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              We don't accept direct job submissions, but we regularly index job
              posts from employers who use supported applicant tracking systems.
              The best way to ensure your job appears on our platform is to post
              it on your company's careers page.
