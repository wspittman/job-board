            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                We think so! Traditional job boards prioritize employers' needs
                over a seamless experience for job seekers. This is why so many
                of them end up with cluttered interfaces and generic search
                functions. Better Job Board is different: we put the job seeker
                front and center. This focus leads to a streamlined, user-first
                experience with powerful, intuitive search and filtering tools.
                We're here to make finding the right job faster, simpler, and a
                whole lot better.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                We pull job posts directly from known employers, accessing their
                applicant tracking systems (ATS) through official APIs. This
                way, we ensure high-quality, up-to-date posts while our smart
                search surfaces the most relevant opportunities for you.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                We refresh our job posts daily to ensure you're seeing the
                latest opportunities. With that level of freshness, you can
                apply while they're still hot!

                The live application shows the exact time of the most recent

              <p>
                When you find a job you're interested in, just click "Apply" and
                we'll direct you to the employer's official application page. We
                never stand between you and the employer â€“ you'll always apply
                directly through their preferred channel.

              <p>
                When you update your search criteria, the URL in your browser's
                address bar will update automatically. You can bookmark this URL
                to save your search and return to it later. Using the bookmark
                will restore your search criteria and re-run the search.

                We update our job posts every day and remove any that are no
                longer accepting applications. If you see it here, it was
                verified as active within the last 24 hours! If you do find a
                job that has been taken down since our last update, the apply
                link won't work.

                We're committed to privacy-first job search. We don't require an

                misuse, but this data isn't linked to personal identities.

                We don't accept direct job submissions, but we regularly index
                job posts from employers who use supported applicant tracking
                systems. The best way to ensure your job appears on our platform
                is to post it on your company's careers page.
