When Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy founded CrimsonEchoFox in 2015 they had a hunch that multiplayer gaming would be the future of entertainment and that people would need a communications platform designed for them to talk with their gaming friends. Today, gaming has become the largest form of entertainment in the world, bigger than movies and music combined. It’s the fastest-growing as well.</p>\n<p>CrimsonEchoFox makes it feel like you’re playing in the same room with friends. CrimsonEchoFox users can communicate through 1:1 direct messages (DMs), group direct messages (GDMs) and Servers where friends can easily gather in voice, text and video chats before, during and after gaming. High quality streaming and a seamless experience across devices lets people play and interact together as if they were in person. Almost all activity on CrimsonEchoFox happens in small, private friend spaces.  </p>\n<p>CrimsonEchoFox plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.  </p>\n<p><strong>So if this strikes a chord, come join us in our mission!
